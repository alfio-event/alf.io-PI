checkIn.color.default=success

#To apply a specific color, define the key, which is
#checkIn.color.category.
# + your category name (only ASCII chars, kebab-case. Please check backend/src/test/kotlin/alfio/pi/ApplicationTest.kt for some corner-case samples)

#checkIn.color.category.long-category-name=warning
#
# please do not use "danger" as category color, as it will be confusing for the operator (danger is used to display errors). You have been warned.
